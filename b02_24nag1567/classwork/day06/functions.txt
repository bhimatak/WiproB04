1. proto typing of a function
    (decalring a function)
    ex: int addition(int, int);
    
    Note: there is no body of the function

2. defining a function
    set of instruction involved in executing
    to get the desired output
    ex:
        int addition(int val1, int val2)
        {
            //body of the function
            int result=0;
            result = val1+val2;
            return (result);
        }
3. calling/invoking a function
    here we are actully asking the compiler to 
    execute the function which is having defination
    of a function

    ex:
    main()
    {
        int res=0;
        res = addition(2,3); //calling/invoking a function
        printf("\nresult = %d", res);
        res = addition(21,31); //reuability
        printf("\nresult = %d", res);
        
    }



*) calling a function is involved with two types
    1. call by value
    2. call by pointer/reference
